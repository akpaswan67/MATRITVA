            <h3>1. Push-Up</h3>
            <p>Start on your hands and knees on a yoga mat on the floor, with your hands resting slightly wider than the
                width
                of your shoulders. Straighten your legs out behind you so you're being supported by your hands and the
                balls of
                your feet. Keep your body in a straight line from the top of your head to your heels (holding your head
                up in
                line with your spine). Bend your elbows and lower your chest until it nearly touches the mat. Pause and
                then
                push yourself back up to the starting position. Beginner modification: Complete the push-up with your
                knees on
                the floor. One set is 12 reps.

            <p>
                Complete a push-up (either on your knees or with your legs extended behind you, depending on your
                fitness
                level). Then, keep your core engaged and shuffle your right hand and right foot a step to the right
                side. Bring
                your left hand and foot to meet them. Complete another push-up there. Return to center and repeat on the
                opposite side. One set is five shuffles in each direction.

                squeeze
                your chest as hard as you can. Hold the tension for up to 30 seconds and release; that's one rep.

            <h3> 1. Triceps Dip </h3>
            <p>
                Sit in front of a bench or the end of a couch with your legs extended out in front of you away from the
                furniture. Position your hands on top of the furniture behind you with your hands about shoulder-width
                apart and
                your fingertips pointing toward your body. Straighten your arms and pull your body up so it is hovering
                over the
                floor. Then engage your triceps muscles as you bend your elbows until they're at about a 90-degree
                angle. Press
                down from your hands and straighten your arms to return to the starting position. You should be
                supporting most
                of your body's weight in your arms to get the greatest benefit from the move. To make the exercise
                easier, keep
                your knees bent at a 90-degree angle. One set is 12 reps.

            <h3> 2. Plank Up & Downs </h3>
            <p>
                Get into a plank position on the floor: Your hands should be on the mat with your shoulders directly
                above them,
                legs extended straight back behind you, toes on the mat, and your body forming a straight line from top
                of head
                to heels. Lower your left elbow down to the mat and then lower your right elbow down to the mat so
                you're now in
                a forearm plank. Keep your core engaged and your body in a straight line. Push up and straighten your
                right arm.
                Then straighten your left arm as well. Repeat for 30 seconds, switching off which arm goes first; thatâ€™s
                one set

            <h3> 3.Triangle Push-Ups </h3>
            <p> Settle into a plank position but place your hands close together under your chest and form a triangle
                with your
                index fingers and your thumbs (your thumbs should be in a straight line forming the bottom side of the
                triangle). Lower your chest toward the floor as if you were doing a regular push-up, keeping your elbows
                close
                to your body. Pause at the bottom and then push off the floor to return to the starting position. Modify
                by
                completing the push-up with your knees on the floor or by moving your hands slightly wider than the
                triangle
                shape. One set is 12 reps

                At the same time, step your right hand and left foot forward while staying close to the floor. Then move
                your
                left hand and right foot forward. Repeat up the length of the mat and then reverse directions (up and
                back
                down
                your mat is one rep), ideally for 20 reps; that's one set.
